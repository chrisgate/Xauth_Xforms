# Xauth_Xforms
This solution demonstrates using Xamarin.Auth 1.6+ with a Xamarin.Forms solution built from the recent release version of the Visual Studio Xamarin Forms template.

NOTE: You MUST provide your own backend solution on Azure and MOST IMPORTANTLY: Your OWN APP IDs and APP SECRETS for the authentication providers you wish to support.  These can be found in App.xaml.cs.
